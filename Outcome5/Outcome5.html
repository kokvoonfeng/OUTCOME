		1. Explain the factors that aﬀect the ﬁle size of an image: number of colours, ﬁle compression, physical pixel dimensions, ﬁle type.

		Answer:
	</h1>
	<h2>
		 The size of the image file have a method reduce is reduce the image resolution., that will affect the image quality and file size. Common image file types include JPG, GIF and PNG. When the image is enlarged, the pixels are pulled And then become a larger block. This is  images appear as poor quality when enlarged too much.

	</h1>
	<h1>
		Answer:
	</h1>
	<h2>
		PNG has three main advantages over GIF, first alpha channels variable transparency , PNG also compression better than GIF in almost every case and the GIF format can also be interlaced, but the quality is not nearly as good, or fast as a PNG. Graphics file formats There are two different ways to support transparent image areas such as simple binary transparency and alpha transparency. The GIF format supports simple binary transparency, and a color in the index palette is marked as a transparent color. The PNG format supports alpha transparency, and transparency information is stored on a separate channel.

		3. Describe the common methods to optimise images download size and number or requests from web server.
	</h1>
	<h1>
		Answer:
	</h1>
	<h2>
		Images account for most of the downloaded bytes on web page. The fewer bytes the browser has to download, the less competition there is for the client bandwidth and the faster the browser can download and render useful content on the screen. First, sure the image is complete quality and the sure internet smooth because may be will cause image incomplete.
